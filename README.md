# DOTW-Final-Project

I originally was going to go to college for astrophysics, so in my final CS project I’m going to center my project around an outer-space theme. In terms of experience, I’m interested in creating an experience that is personal to each user, so that the drawings are interactive in such a way that the user can customize different aspects of the environment to their own personal taste. I’m interested in the user as a collaborator of the drawing and their own experience of it — I very much want the user to be an active part of the drawing’s creation. I’m aesthetically interested in minimalism and a more fun, cartoon-ish exploration of outer-space as opposed to realism. In an effort to create somewhat of a narrative experience, I would also like the pages to each to explore different “depths” of space. Part of my love of astrophysics are the transitions between celestial and planetary objects:  from earth to space to solar system to deep space to  andromeda to deeper space etc… It is important to me that the pages embrace the relationship between these objects. In this way, I want a drawing relative to the Earth, one for the solar system and one for deep space. I want the navigation to be representative of the three distinct “parts” of space that each page expands upon.
